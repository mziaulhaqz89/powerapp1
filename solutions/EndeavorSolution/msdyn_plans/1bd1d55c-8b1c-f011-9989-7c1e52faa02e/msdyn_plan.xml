  <msdyn_prompt>I need to be able to track projects.
Project has start and end date, completion date, Invoicing method, Engagment Manager, Project manager,Project Value,Billing Frequency, and add other fields you think necessary. 
There can be multiple projects against a business unit

Project belongs to specific client. Use existing Contact table from dataverse for client data
Each client can have multiple projects. The client information is also important as the client can be contacted via email/phone etc. 


A project manager should be able to create/update new project record. 
There is a backoffice role users who generates invoices against a project. 
Invoices are created against a project, The invoice should have Title, Total Fee, Total Expenses , Invoice Total fields, Other Invoice Instructions

We would like to add every project entry in an excel sheet, This should be done automatically every time a project is created or updated</msdyn_prompt>
